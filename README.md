mailcow
=====

mailcow is a mail server suite based on Dovecot, Postfix and other open source software, that provides a modern Web UI for administration.
In future versions mailcow will provide Cal- and CardDAV support.

For **Debian and Debian based distributions**. 

This script is permanently **tested on Debian stable (8.x) and old-stable (7.x)**.
Debian Squeeze is not supported.

Please see https://www.debinux.de/mailcow for further information.
Feel free to leave a comment or question.

# Before You Begin
- **Please remove any web- and mail services** running on your server. I recommend using a clean Debian minimal installation.
Remember to purge Debians default MTA Exim4:
```
apt-get purge exim4*
``` 

- If there is any firewall, unblock the following ports for incoming connections:

| Service               | Protocol | Port |
| -------------------   |:--------:|:-----|
| Postfix Submission    | TCP      | 587  |
| Postfix SMTPS         | TCP      | 465  |
| Postfix SMTP          | TCP      | 25   |
| Dovecot IMAP          | TCP      | 143  |
| Dovecot IMAPS         | TCP      | 993  |
| Dovecot ManageSieve   | TCP      | 4190 |
| HTTPS                 | TCP      | 443  |
| HTTP (301+autoconfig) | TCP      | 80   |

- Next it is important that you **do not use Google DNS** or another public DNS which is known to be blocked by DNS-based Blackhole List (DNSBL) providers.

# Installation
**Please run all commands as root**

**Download a stable release**

Download mailcow to whichever directory (using ~/build here).
Replace "v0.x" with the tag of the latest release: https://github.com/andryyy/mailcow/releases/latest
```
mkdir ~/build ; cd ~/build
wget -O - https://github.com/andryyy/mailcow/archive/v0.x.tar.gz | tar xfz -
cd mailcow-*
```

**Now edit the file "configuration" to fit your needs!**
```
nano mailcow.config
```

* **sys_hostname** - Hostname without domain
* **sys_domain** - Domain name. "$sys_hostname.$sys_domain" equals to FQDN.
* **sys_timezone** - The timezone must be definied in a valid format (Europe/Berlin, America/New_York etc.)
* **conf_httpd** - Select wether to use Nginx ("nginx") or Apache2 ("apache2"). Nginx is default.
* **my_dbhost** - ADVANCED: Leave as-is ("localhost") for a local database installation
* **my_defaultsfile** - ADVANCED: Leave as-is for a local database installation. If you want to install the database on a remote server, create a proper mysql defaults file to connect to the remote host ([see example](https://gist.github.com/andryyy/98698e42d9d8b1e97a99)).
* **my_forceexisting** - ADVANCED: Exit if no useable MySQL installation was found.
* **my_mailcowdb, my_mailcowuser, my_mailcowpass** - MySQL database name, username and password for use with Postfix. **You can use the default values.**
* **my_rcdb, my_rcuser, my_rcpass** - MySQL database name, username and password for Roundcube. **You can use the default values.**
* **my_rootpw** - MySQL root password is generated automatically by default. You can define a complex password here if you want to.
* **mailcow_admin_user and mailcow_admin_pass** - Postfixadmin superuser definition: **Username MUST end with a valid domain name** but **does NOT need to be yours**. "yourname@outlook.com" is fine, "yourname@domain.invalid" or "yourname@aname" is not. Password policy: minimum length 8 chars, must contain uppercase and lowercase letters and at least 2 digits. **You can use the default values**
* **"cert-" vars** - Used for the self-signed certificate. CN will be the servers FQDN. "cert_country" must be a vaild two letter country code.
* **inst_debug** - Sets Bash mode -x
* An unattended installation is possible, but not recommended ("inst_unattended")
* Set **conf_done** to **yes** or anything except "no".

**Empty configuration values are invalid!**

You are ready to start the script:
```
./install.sh
```
Just be patient and confirm every step by pressing [ENTER] or [CTRL-C] to interrupt the installation.
If you run into problems, try to locate the error with "inst_debug" enabled in your configuration.
Please contact me when you need help or found a bug.

More debugging is about to come. Though everything should work as intended.

After the installation, visit your dashboard @ **https://hostname.domain.tld**, use the logged credentials in `./installer.log`

Remember to create an alias- or a mailbox for Postmaster. ;-)

# Upgrade
**Please run all commands as root**

Upgrade is supported since mailcow v0.7.x. From v0.9 on you do not need the file `installer.log` from a previous installation.

The mailcow configuration file will not be read, so there is no need to adjust it in any way before upgrading.

To start the upgrade, run the following command:
```
./install.sh -u
```

# Configuration and common tasks
To help you modify the configuration, I created this little overview to get you started.

## SSL certificate
The SSL certificate is located at `/etc/ssl/mail/mail.{key,crt}`.
You can replace it by just copying over your own files. 
Services effected and necessary to restart are `postfix`, `dovecot` and `nginx` (Nginx if installed, Apache2 does not have a body size limitation configured).

## Spamassassin
Spamassassin main configuration file:
* **/etc/spamassassin/local.cf**

### Autolearn
Move undetected spam to "Junk" to make Spamassassin autolearn it. This is done by a daily cronjob.

Ham (non-spam) is learned the same way. Move false-positives to your inbox to autolearn them.

### Spam rewrite
mailcow adds `rewrite_header Subject [SPAM]` and `report_safe 2` to prefix [SPAM] to junk mail and forward spam as attachment instead of original message (text/plain). 

The prefix "[SPAM]" is not important for the sieve filter and can be changed to whatever text. Spam will be moved when te Spam Flag is set the header.

### Spamassassin daemon options
Default startup options for Spamassassin in `/etc/default/spamassassin`:
- Enabled "spamd" by adding `ENABLED=1`
- Enabled cronjob by setting `CRON=1`
- Modified OPTIONS line to `OPTIONS="--create-prefs --max-children 5 --helper-home-dir"`.

## Postfix
The files "main.cf" and "master.cf" contain a lot of changes. You should now what you do if you modify these files.
* **/etc/postfix/main.cf**
* **/etc/postfix/master.cf**

I try to comment as much as possible inside these files to help you understand the configuration.

You also find the SQL based maps for virtual transport here:
* **/etc/postfix/sql/*.cf**

For a quick overview of the restrictions [click here](https://github.com/andryyy/mailcow/blob/master/postfix/conf/main.cf).

## HTTPd
A site named "000-0-mail" is copied to `/etc/{nginx,apache2}/sites-available` - depending on your configuration - and enabled via symbolic link to `[...]/sites-enabled`.

The sites root location is `/var/www/mail/`. 

Other sites will not be touched/changed/removed by mailcow (>= v0.9).

A PHP socket (>> `/var/run/php5-fpm-mail.sock`) configuration is located at `/etc/php5/fpm/pool.d/mail.conf`. 
Some PHP parameters are set right here to override those in `/etc/php5/fpm/php.ini`.

Both Apache2 and Nginx will make use of FastCGI to call PHP5. Apache2 uses a **non-free** module *mod_fastcgi*.

## Fail2ban
A file `/etc/fail2ban/jail.local` is created with some pre-configured jails.

Ban time is set to 1h. "Jails" are created to lock unauthorized users (Postfix SASL [authentication], Sieve. etc.).
Default configuration parameters (example: retry count) can be reviewed in `/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf`.

I recommend to use `/etc/fail2ban/jail.local` to add or modify the configuration. 
`jail.local` has higher priority than `jail.conf`.

## Postfixadmin
The file "config.local.php" is copied to the target directory `/var/www/mail/pfadmin`. Some parameters like "domain.tld" are dummies and replaced by the installer.

You can change some of these values to fit your personal needs by just editing or adding them to this file. 
All values inside "config.local.php" override the global configuration file (`config.inc.php`) of Postfixadmin. No need to reload any service afterwards. 

**Default quotas in MiB**

## Dovecot
If you really need to edit Dovecots configuration, you can find the required files in `/etc/dovecot`.

`/etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf` holds the default configuration. To keep it simple I chose not to split the configuration into multiple files. 

### Trash folder quota

The folder "Trash" is configured to allow an extra 100% of the set quota to allow moving mails to trash when a mailbox reaches >=51% of its quota. 

This is defined with `quota_rule2 = Trash:storage=+100%%` in `/etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf`.

### Dovecot SQL parameter
Dovecots SQL parameters can be found in either `/etc/dovecot/dovecot-dict-sql.conf` or `/etc/dovecot/dovecot-mysql.conf`.

- `dovecot-dict-sql.conf` holds instructions for reading a users quota.

- `dovecot-mysql.conf` contains some basic SQL commands:
**driver** - What database  
**connect** - How to connect to the MySQL database   **default_pass_scheme** - Password scheme. If you edit this you also need to adjust Postfixadmin!  
**password_query** - Validate passwords.  
**user_query** - Validate users.  
**iterate_query** - Iterate users, also needed by a lot of "doveadm" commands.  


Furthermore a script `doverecalcq` is copied to `/etc/cron.daily` to recalculate quotas of all users daily.
 
A system with a very large amount of virtual users should not do this on a daily basis. I recommend to move the script to "cron.weekly" then.

*Dovecot saves messages to `/var/vmail/DOMAINNAME/USERNAME` in maildir format.*

## Roundcube

Roundcube is configured by multiple configuration files.

There are two files for the general configuration:

`/var/www/mail/rc/config/defaults.php.inc` and `/var/www/mail/rc/config/config.php.inc`. 
The later file is the one you want to edit. Every parameter set in `config.php.inc` will override the parameter set in `defaults.php.inc`.

Some plug-ins come with a seperate "config.inc.php" file. You can find them in `/var/www/mail/rc/plugins/PLUGIN_NAME/`.

If no domain is specified for a login address, the webservers domain part will be appended.

## Change attachment/message size
Default file size limit is set to 25 MB. If you want to change this, either use the mailcow control center or the command `mailcow_msg_size` in a terminal:

```
mailcow_msg_size VALUE_IN_MB
``` 

# Uninstall
Run `bash misc/purge.sh` from within mailcow directory to remove mailcow main components.

Your web server + web root, MySQL server + databases as well as your mail directory (/var/vmail) will **not** be removed (>= v0.9).

Please open and review the script before running it!

**You can perform a FULL WIPE** by appending `--all`:

```bash misc/purge.sh --all```

This WILL purge sensible data like your web root, databases + MySQL installation, mail directory and more...
